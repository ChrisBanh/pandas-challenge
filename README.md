# pandas-challenge

## PyCitySchools

This is the pandas challenge where the goal of this is to utilise pandas and the jupyter notebook to merge datasets of both the schools and the students listed. A general overview must be created for the merged dataframe for each of the schools including enrolment size, type, budget, average scores and passing percentage. Schools are ordered based off their the overall passing percentage metric from best to worst.

Overall performance is also broken down into other various matreics and brackets such as budget per student, school sizes and the type of school listed within each of the dataframe. 

The main purpose of correlating and rearranging all of the data and creating various dataframes, is to ultimately summarise the data and also note down the key trends within the dataset through the manipulation of data.
