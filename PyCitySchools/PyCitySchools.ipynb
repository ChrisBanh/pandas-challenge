    "### OBSERVATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "The observation that we can see through the per_school_summary df is that government schools has more students enrolled in comparison to the independent schools on average. Governemnt schools like Bailey and Johnson both have over 4000 enrolled students. Independent schools like Pena and Holden both have less than 1000 students enrolled into either of these independent schools. We can also see that the average and hence passing rate for the maths exams is higher than the reading component. There also a correlation with the number of enrolled studetns and the respective school budget. Large schools requires a bigger budget. To overall pass, the students need to pass both the reading and maths components, each of which ahs a minimum of 50%. \n",
    "We can see that by arranging by the size of schools, that larger schools (2000+) also tend to perform worse on average compared to other schools within the lower studen count price brackers\n",
    "\n",
    "The first main comparison that we can see is that independent schools tend to perform better on average compared to government schools. We can observe these trends through both the top performing school through overall pass rate and the scores by school type. The overall percentage of students passing overall is approx 76.97% compared to government school with approx. 70.7%. Also when referring to the top 5 schools by overall passing rate, 3 of the 5 are independent whereas 4 of the 5 bottom schools rated through the same metric are are government.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second main comparison is related to the the student budgets and how it ties into their overall passing rate. One may think the more being spend correlates to increased likelihood of passing, but in fact, it appears to be inversed. Studetns with budgets betweeen 645 and 680 on average has a lower overall passing percentage compared to lower price brackets (66.67% compared to 75.58% for the under 580. The assumption can be drawn here that students that might be academically struggling require a larger budget to pass. \n",

    "PS: I ultimately wanted to use df.style.format for formatting my results into specific decimal places and exponential figures as it reduces visual clutter. However I ran into a styling issue after summaring the schools and their statistics especially for the top and bottom schools sorting. Hence I switched over back to the map formatting for the per_school_summary. Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66081411/permantly-apply-style-format-to-a-dataframe\n",
